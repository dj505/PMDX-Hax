# Project Mirai DX Hacks

## What is this?

This is a repository for the Project Mirai DX romhacks. Project Mirai is a rhythm game for the Nintendo 3DS, and my goal here is to make it easy to start adding custom songs, graphics, charts, and everything to the game.

# Matryohska Edition

This is my first romhack for the game. Here's a list of most of the changes:
- Some songs have experimental Expert modes! A few of these crash the game, and none are complete, but likely will be in the future.
- Matryoshka uses Lon and Soraru's cover of the song
- 1 2 Fanclub also uses Lon and Soraru's cover
- Opening music and video have been replaced
- New loading screen textures
- 1/6 -out of the gravity- has been replaced with Two-Faced Lovers (100% full credit to Stewie1.0, borrowed from their Mix Edition hack)
- Len and Gumi recolors that match Lon and Soraru's characters in the Matryoshka PV (seen in the intro)
- My own custom Playstation button icons replace the default A/B/X/Y icons in-game!
- Restored animated PVs from Mirai 2 for songs that used them
- A few more things

TODO:
[ ] Actually add full custom songs
[ ] Make the game not crash too often
[ ] Fix 'No Logic' (currently either crashes or is nightmare fuel)
[x] Proper playstation buttons (Done! The old ones looked terrible)
